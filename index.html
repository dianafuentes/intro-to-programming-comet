<h2>About</h2>

<p> I am a mom and wife that is trying to make a name for her self, who has asperations to pave the way for not only my son but other individuals. Both of my parents are undocumented and I have grown up in a society that has undervalued us, and this often foments a sense of low self esteem that is untrue yet weighs heavy at times. I would be lying if I said that everything since becoming a mom has been easy with unfinished goals due to change in priorities. I would often get discourage on begining my coding journey, I would often get inposter syndrom, I was stuck with a complex mindset. Within this past year of networking, I got inspired by other women/mothers like myself to be confident and be persistant. At the end of the day we are all learning or helping others. Coding has helped me  </p>
